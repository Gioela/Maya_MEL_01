Script 1) 
	Write a procedure that has 4 arguments: 3 strings (objA, objB, objC) and 1 int x_number
	when running the proc, objC should get duplicated x_number of times
	and be distributed evenly in a line between objA and objB.
Script 2) 
	Write a script that will work with the zombie rig and based on selected ctrls
	make the other side symmetrical (so that both sides look the same). 
	The minimum for this assignments should be a proc that will take whatever 
	is selected and mirror the attribute values to the other side.
	Write a little UI around it that lets the user specify if they want to mirror
	or if they want to switch (so that the right will be like left and left will be like right).
Script 3) 
	Extend the script that we wrote in class for the zombie rig to also Save the current state of
	the controls and Load the saved states. Write a UI to use all three scripts that we wrote;
